## [Project Insert in sorted linked list](./insert_in_sorted_linked_list/)
### Description
The "Insert in sorted linked list" algorithm allows the sorted insertion of a new node into a linked list, ensuring that the list remains sorted from smallest to largest based on the value contained in the nodes (n). 

This function is useful for maintaining ordered lists and is a fundamental part of managing data and data structures in programming.

---
## [Project Heap Insert](./heap_insert/)
### Description
An insertion into a data structure known as a "binary max-heap." A maximal binary heap is a data structure in which each parent node has a value greater than or equal to the values of its child nodes. 

The heap_insert algorithm is used to add a new value to a maximum binary heap and maintain ownership of the heap.

---
## [Project Minimum Operations](./minimum_operations/)

---
## [Project Sandpiles](./sandpiles/)

### Description
It is a program used to work with two-dimensional arrays that represent piles of sand. 

The main objective of this algorithm is to calculate the sum of two piles of sand and apply rules that ensure the stability of the sum. 

Each cell in the matrix represents a point in the sand pile and contains a number that represents the amount of sand in that cell.

---
## [Project linked_list_palindrome](./linked_list_palindrome/)

### Description
It is a data structure in which a linked list, which is a collection of elements connected to each other by nodes, forms a sequence that reads the same forward and backward. 

In other words, the elements of the linked list are arranged in such a way that when they are traversed from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning, the same sequence of values is obtained. This means that the data stored in the linked list is a palindrome. 

Checking whether a linked list is a palindrome often involves traversing the list and comparing the values both ways to determine if they are equal.

---
## [Project log_parsing](./log_parsing/)

### Description
Its main goal is to extract useful information from these logs, such as file sizes and HTTP status codes, and keep track of this information as it processes lines of standard input. 

The algorithm calculates the total size of the files and keeps track of the number of occurrences of specific HTTP status codes. 

Every time it processes 10 lines, it prints the total file size and status code counts in alphabetical order. Log parsing is useful for analyzing and summarizing large sets of logs, which can be valuable in monitoring, troubleshooting, and reporting tasks related to systems or web services.

---
## [Project Linked list cycle](./linked_list_cycle/)

### Description
It is a data structure used in programming to represent a sequence of elements, where one or more elements of the list are linked in such a way that they form a loop or cycle.

This means that following links or references from one item to the next will eventually return to the same item within the list.
Linked list cycles are used in algorithms and data structures for various applications, such as cycle detection in linked lists, algorithm optimization, and data representation in graph problems, among others.

These loops can be useful in situations where you need to loop through a sequence of elements repeatedly or where it is important to detect loops in a data structure.

---
## [Project Palindrome integer](./palindrome_integer/)

### Description
A palindrome is a sequence of characters, whether a word, phrase, or number, that reads the same way from left to right and from right to left.

In other words, it is a symmetrical structure that does not change when reversed, like "`bear`," "`recognize`," or "`1221`."

## [Project UTF-8 Validation](./utf8_validation/)

### Description
---
## [Project 2048 (single line)](./slide_line/)

### Description
It aims to slide and merge a line of integers left or right. The number line is represented as a one-dimensional array.

---
## [2D Menger Sponge](./menger/)

### Description
The Menger algorithm, also known as the `"Menger Set"` or the `"Menger Sponge"`, is a three-dimensional fractal that can be considered a generalization of the Sierpinski triangle to three dimensions.

However, in this description, we will focus on the `2D Menger Sponge`, which is a simplification of the three-dimensional fractal.

---
## [N Queens](./nqueens/)

### Description
The algorithm solves the N queens problem, which consists of placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no queen threatens another. The solution uses the `backtracking` technique, which is a recursive strategy to explore all possible board configurations.

In summary, the algorithm finds and displays all possible solutions to the N queens problem, meeting the requirements and constraints specified in the instructions.

---
## [Array to AVL](./sorted_array_to_avl/)

### Description

## [Rotate 2D Matrix](./rotate_2d_matrix/)
### Description
The rotate_2d_matrix function takes a square `two-dimensional` array as input and rotates the array 90 degrees clockwise in-place. First, perform a transpose of the matrix by `swapping` elements along the main diagonal. Then, `invert` each row of the matrix. This process directly modifies the input matrix, thus achieving efficient 90 degree rotation in

---
## [Find the Loop](./rotate_2d_matrix/)
### Description
The function find_listint_loop is designed to detect and find the starting node of a loop in a singly linked list. It uses the `Floyd's Tortoise` and `Hare algorithm`, where two pointers `traverse` the list at different `speeds`. If there is a loop, the two pointers will eventually meet at some point within the loop.

---
## [Merge Sort](./merge_sort/)
### Description
The key idea behind Merge Sort is that it exploits the fact that it is easier to `merge` two sorted arrays than to `sort` an unsorted array directly. This algorithm guarantees a time complexity of `O(nlog(n))`in all cases, making it more efficient than some other sorting algorithms for large datasets.

---
## [Making Change](./making_change/)
### Description
The `makeChange` function aims to determine the minimum number of coins needed to reach a given total amount, using a set of coins with different denominations. The algorithm prioritizes the use of higher denomination coins, sorting them in descending order to minimize the total number of coins used.

---
## [Double Circular Linked List](./double_circular_linked_list/)
### Description
The provided code implements two `C` functions for manipulating a `doubly circular list`. These functions allow adding new nodes to the end or beginning of the list, each node containing a string of characters `(str)`. Including the use of dynamic memory `(malloc and strdup)` as well as properly updating pointers to maintain the circular list structure.

---
## [Radix Sort](./radix_sort/)
### Description
A sorting algorithm that arranges the elements of a list based on each digit, starting with the least significant and moving toward the most significant.

**Least Significant Digit (LSD):** The least significant digit of a number, it is the first digit used for sorting during the first iteration of the Radix Sort algorithm.

**Counting Algorithm:** A counting algorithm is used to arrange the elements based on the current digit during each iteration of the Radix Sort. This step involves counting the frequency of each digit and using that information to place the items in the correct position.

**Stable Algorithm:** Refers to the fact that the relative order of elements with equal digits is maintained during the sorting process. This ensures that if two elements have the same digit in a particular position, their relative order will not be altered during sorting.

**Significant Digit:** Each position in a number that contributes to the total value of the number. In the context of Radix Sort, iterations are performed based on the least significant digits towards the most significant digits.

**Iteration:** Each pass through the array during which the elements are sorted based on a specific digit.

**Relative Order:** The relative position of the elements in the list before and after an iteration of the Radix Sort algorithm.

**Complete Sorting:** The final result of the process, where all elements are sorted by all digits, from least significant to most significant.

## [Island Perimeter](./island_perimeter/)
### Description

This code implements a function that calculates the perimeter of an island represented by a `2D` grid. The grid consists of `0` and `1`, where 0 represents `water` and 1 represents `land`. The function traverses each grid cell and calculates the perimeter based on the number of land cells and their adjacent land cells. Finally, it returns the total perimeter of the island.

---
## [AVL Trees](./avl_trees/)
### Description

It is a tool for checking whether a given binary tree is a `valid` AVL tree, which can be useful for ensuring that a tree data structure meets certain balance properties.

---
## [Wild Compare](./wild_cmp/)
### Description

The wildcmp function compares `two strings`, s1 and s2, allowing s2 to contain the `special character` '' which can represent any string (including an empty string). It uses a `recursive` approach to compare the characters in both strings, especially handling the '' character. If both strings can be considered identical, return 1; otherwise, it returns 0. This function provides a flexible way to compare strings, allowing partial matches based on the '*' as a `wildcard`.
