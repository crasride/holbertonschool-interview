[Project Sandpiles](./sandpiles/)

### Description
It is a program used to work with two-dimensional arrays that represent piles of sand. The main objective of this algorithm is to calculate the sum of two piles of sand and apply rules that ensure the stability of the sum. Each cell in the matrix represents a point in the sand pile and contains a number that represents the amount of sand in that cell.

[Project linked_list_palindrome](./linked_list_palindrome/)

### Description
It is a data structure in which a linked list, which is a collection of elements connected to each other by nodes, forms a sequence that reads the same forward and backward. In other words, the elements of the linked list are arranged in such a way that when they are traversed from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning, the same sequence of values is obtained. This means that the data stored in the linked list is a palindrome. Checking whether a linked list is a palindrome often involves traversing the list and comparing the values both ways to determine if they are equal.

[Project log_parsing](./log_parsing/)

### Description
Its main goal is to extract useful information from these logs, such as file sizes and HTTP status codes, and keep track of this information as it processes lines of standard input. The algorithm calculates the total size of the files and keeps track of the number of occurrences of specific HTTP status codes. Every time it processes 10 lines, it prints the total file size and status code counts in alphabetical order. Log parsing is useful for analyzing and summarizing large sets of logs, which can be valuable in monitoring, troubleshooting, and reporting tasks related to systems or web services.

[Project Linked list cycle](./linked_list_cycle/)

### Description
It is a data structure used in programming to represent a sequence of elements, where one or more elements of the list are linked in such a way that they form a loop or cycle. This means that following links or references from one item to the next will eventually return to the same item within the list. Linked list cycles are used in algorithms and data structures for various applications, such as cycle detection in linked lists, algorithm optimization, and data representation in graph problems, among others. These loops can be useful in situations where you need to loop through a sequence of elements repeatedly or where it is important to detect loops in a data structure.

[Project Palindrome integer](./palindrome_integer/)

### Description
A palindrome is a sequence of characters, whether a word, phrase, or number, that reads the same way from left to right and from right to left.

In other words, it is a symmetrical structure that does not change when reversed, like "`bear`," "`recognize`," or "`1221`."
